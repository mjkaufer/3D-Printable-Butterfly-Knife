#3D-Printable-Butterfly-Knife

Files for the knife are located in /3D-Files, if you couldn't guess.

There are open and closed files for your viewing pleasure, and a plain file meant to 3D print.

You can actually view .STL files in GitHub via the browser! Crazy stuff!

The knife is assembled by screwing two M3 screws through the top holes of the handle after lining them up with the knife. Add M3 washers as well for better flipping action.

I have yet to print this model out, so print at your own risk.

Please don't stab people with it.

I had to use 123D Design because Inventor wouldn't load on my laptop. It was a struggle.
